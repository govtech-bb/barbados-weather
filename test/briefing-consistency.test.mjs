/**
 * Tests for looksConsistentWithLevel (issue #52).
 *
 * The system prompt instructs Claude to NEVER change the threat level
 * the engine decided. But a prompt-injection attempt smuggled in via
 * NHC text (or a model that drifts) could write a briefing that
 * announces the wrong level. Validate at output time: if any UPPERCASE
 * level token *other* than the expected one appears in the text,
 * treat the briefing as drifted and fall back to the deterministic
 * template.
 *
 * Conservative on purpose: lowercase "warning" / "watch" are normal
 * English (e.g. "fair warning", "watch for puddles") and don't trip.
 * Only the explicit UPPERCASE level tokens, which Claude has no reason
 * to write naturally, count as a deviation.
