/**
 * WAFv2 web ACL for the CloudFront distribution (issue #22).
 *
 * Without this, the distribution is a thin pass-through to a single
 * 256 CPU / 512 MB Fargate task with no autoscaling — trivially DoS-able.
 * The managed rule groups (Common + Known Bad Inputs) cover the bulk of
 * generic layer-7 attacks; the rate-based rule caps any one IP at
 * 2,000 requests per 5-minute window, which is generous for a real
 * human (~7 req/s sustained) but kills bot floods cheaply.
 *
 * CloudFront-scoped WAFs MUST live in us-east-1; the default provider
 * is already configured for us-east-1 (see main.tf), so no aliased
 * provider is needed unless this stack is ever moved to another region.
